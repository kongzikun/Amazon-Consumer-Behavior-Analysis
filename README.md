# Amazon Consumer Behavior Analysis

**A multi-faceted exploration of the Open E-commerce 1.0 dataset (2018-2022), revealing patterns in American digital consumer behaviour through temporal analysis, demographic segmentation, and machine-learning-based customer archetypes.**

## Overview
The Open E-commerce 1.0 dataset contains 1.8 million Amazon purchase records from more than 5,000 U.S. shoppers, linked to an extensive demographic survey. By cleansing and merging transactional and survey data we build a comprehensive view of how households interact with Amazon, how behaviour shifted during COVID-19, and which customer segments deliver the most value. Visual analytics drive each insight, emphasising the value of interactive dashboards for business and academic research.

## Highlights
- Comprehensive demographic dashboards covering gender, age, income, and household composition.
- Temporal breakdowns that surface quarterly trends, monthly spend versus purchase frequency, daily activity heatmaps, and seasonal decomposition.
- Behavioural insights that quantify product diversity, purchase intensity, and cross-demographic spending patterns.
- Event-driven analyses, including COVID-19 impact studies and annotated time-series callouts.
- Advanced segmentation using an RFM model and K-Means clustering to identify High-Value Champions, Frequent Buyers, and At-Risk cohorts.
- Migration analytics tracing state-to-state movement and tenure changes.
- Publication-ready visual assets saved as high-resolution PNGs and interactive HTML dashboards.

Legacy artefacts from earlier iterations (for example `legacy/data_visualization_script.py` and analytical PDFs in `docs/`) are retained for reference but superseded by the modular source structure above.

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data setup
1. Download `amazon-purchases.csv` (≈300 MB) from the Open E-commerce 1.0 data release; place it in `data/amazon-purchases.csv`.
2. The repository already includes `survey.csv` as a lightweight companion dataset.
3. To store the raw data elsewhere, pass custom paths when instantiating `AmazonDataProcessor`.

### 3. Run the interactive pipeline
```bash
python src/amazon_consumer_analysis.py
```
This command validates data availability, runs preprocessing, and prints a data-quality summary. The module exposes classes such as `DemographicAnalyzer`, `TemporalAnalyzer`, and `BehaviorAnalyzer` for use in notebooks or custom scripts.

### 4. Regenerate publication-ready artefacts
```bash
python src/generate_static_visuals.py
```
The batch job recreates the curated PNG and HTML assets in `assets/images/` and `outputs/interactive/`. Ensure `kaleido` is installed (included in `requirements.txt`) so Plotly can export high-resolution images.

## Outputs
- Interactive Plotly dashboards for demographic, behavioural, temporal, and migration analyses in `outputs/interactive/`.
- Static PNGs suitable for presentations and reports in `assets/images/`.
- Storyboard-style narrative HTML reports in `outputs/visualizations/`.

## Team
This project was developed by Group 2 (SUSTech DS261p):
